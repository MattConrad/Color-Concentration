Color-Concentraion
==================

Concentration memory game using colors and color names.

This is the kid's game Concentration, where you flip over "cards" one at a time for a moment and try to remember their positions, eventually finding pairs of matching cards.

This version has color names, in different colors, which are out of sync. You can play matching either the names or the actual text color. The idea is that the names and colors being out of sync adds extra confusion. (You get used to it if you play a few times.)

This is the Django version, which was ported to GAE (with a different secret key) and is presently running and playable at http://matt-scratch.appspot.com/ .

Drop me a note if you have any trouble getting it running.
